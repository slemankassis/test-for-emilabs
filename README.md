                  <h1>Assignment</h1>
                  <h2>Part one</h2>
                  <p>
                    Like you may already know, Emi is used by huge companies to
                    massively screen candidates. They apply through a job board
                    like Zona Jobs, Bumeran, Indeed, etc. Once they apply, they
                    receive an SMS and an e-mail to start chatting with Emi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, when the screeing interview is finished, the results
                    are processed by a backend application that classifies
                    candidates in two groups: <i>approved</i> and{" "}
                    <i>rejected</i>.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Your goal:</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Create a new backend application that provides the
                      necessary endpoints to retrieve the hardcoded in
                      testData.js. You can use any programming language or
                      framework you feel comfortable with (we suggest using
                      Node).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Then, use this new backend to fetch the candidates and the
                      columns to display (not all recruiters want to see the
                      same data).
                    </li>
                    <li>List all candidates.</li>
                    <li>
                      Add (or at least, name) other desirable features you can
                      think of, for this list view.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Note: How do we know if a candidate was approved or
                    rejected? Each candidate has a 'reason' field. If the field
                    is empty it means that the candidate was approved. On the
                    other hand, if the value is not empty, it means that the
                    candidate was rejected. There may be more than one rejection
                    reason. E.g. salary out of range or minimum age not met.
                  </p>
                  <br></br>
                  <h2>Part two</h2>
                  <p>After displaying the data we want to update it.</p>
                  <p>
                    The backend learns how to classify candidates with the
                    feedback of recruiters. This is core part of the feedback
                    loop for this AI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is why recruiters may occasionally need to re-classify
                    a candidate. This is a manual process that is done based on
                    the results that are shown on the previous step.
                  </p>
                  <h1>Your task:</h1>
                  <p>Allow the recruiters to reclassify candidates.</p>
                  <h4>Manually approving a candidate</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Hit the API endpoint to remove the rejection reasons
                      assigned to a candidate.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure the table is refreshed with the new data.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4>Manually rejecting a candidate</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Hit the API to list all the available rejection reasons.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Let the recruiter select one or more rejection reasons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hit the API again to update that candidate's data.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Note: for this second part, you are allowed to handle state
                    locally, so just add dummy endpoints in your API to be able
                    to do so.
                  </p>
                  <br></br>
                  <h1>Guidelines for part 1 and 2</h1>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      This is a productive application, so it's expected you
                      make changes you would do as if you were working in a real
                      environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Adapt and create React components using the application in
                      this repository to solve the previous requirements.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
